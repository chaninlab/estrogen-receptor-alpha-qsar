# Probing the origin of estrogen receptor alpha inhibition via large-scale QSAR study

This repository is comprised of 4 Jupyter notebooks constituting the entire workflow used in the construction of QSAR model for predicting the pIC50 value of estrogen receptor inhibition.

This repository includes:
* 1_ERa_data_preparation.ipynb
  - Retrieves bioactivity data from ChEMBL database, curates and pre-process the data, compute the fingerprint descriptors
* 2_ER_alpha_RO5.ipynb
* 3_ERa_descriptor_calculation.ipynb
* 4_ERa_multivariate_analysis.ipynb
* requirements.txt
